In order to do a full investigation, their medical team decided to use minimally-invasive [intraocular fine needle aspiration](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8233394/) to take biopsies from the astronauts and their ground-control counterparts.  Using this tissue, they were able to perform immunostaining microscopy as well as RNA sequencing.

But first you must determine if there's any association at all between the RNA-seq gene expression data and the measurements obtained from their medical team.  Your mission is to evaluate the use of random forest and single-layer perceptron classification algorithms to determine if the genes expressed in the retinal tissue are predictive of the phenotypic responses that were observed.
